# Patient-Health-Monitoring-System
IoT based Patient Health Monitoring System which records the patient heart beat rate and body temperature. 

# Abstract
Health monitoring is the major problem in today’s world. Due to lack of proper health monitoring, patient suffer from serious health issues. There are lots of IoT devices now days to monitor the health of patient over internet. Health experts are also taking advantage of these smart devices to keep an eye on their patients.Here in this project, we will make an IoT based Health Monitoring System which records the patient heart beat rate and body temperature. Pulse rate and body temperature readings are recorded over ThingSpeak and Google sheets so that patient health can be monitored from anywhere in the world over internet.

# System Overview
The main components of the setup is arduino uno.It is a microcontroller that is used or automation and supporting various IOT devices like pulseratesensor ,temperature sensor, etc.Pulse Sensor is a well-designed plug-and-play heart-rate sensor for Arduino. The sensor clips onto a fingertip or earlobe and plugs right into Arduino. It also includes an open-source monitoring app that graphs your pulse in real time.The front of the sensor is the covered with the Heart shape logo. This is the side that makes contact with the skin. On the front you see a small round hole, which is where the LED shines through from the back, and there is also a little square just under the LED. The square is an ambient light sensor, exactly like the one used in cellphones, tablets, and laptops, to adjust the screen brightness in different light conditions. The LED shines light into the fingertip or earlobe, or other capillary tissue, and sensor reads the amount of light that bounces back. That’s how it calculates the heart rate. The other side of the sensor is where the rest of the parts are mounted.LM35 is a analog linear temperature sensor. Its output is proportional to the temperature (in degree Celsius). The operating temperature range is from -55°C to 150°C. The output voltage varies by 10mV in response to every oC rise or fall in temperature.Most people call ESP8266 as a WIFI module, but it is actually a microcontroller. ESP8266 is the name of the microcontroller developed by Espressif Systems which is a company based out of shanghai. This microcontroller has the ability to perform WIFI related activities hence it is widely used as a WIFI module.
